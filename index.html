      <h3>Project Management</h3>
      <p>I started my career with the project tendering team and the project management was an additional role alloted for me. However tendering process requires offers & quotations for pricing and the delivery schedules which directly reflects on project
        duration made me realise & learn a lot in project management. As my tenures got shifted to site execution, I have gained a wealth of experience in implementing a project plan, timely reporting for project control, resource planning, material
        planning and manpower allocation.</p>

      <h3>Project Execution</h3>
      <p>My best skill is actually in 'Project Execution', which is considered as just installation based on design/drawings provided. But in my personal terms, I always see 'Project Execution' as an art, in which new ideas and design concepts get its
        birth. I Had a chance of experiencing traditional methods as well as its latest requirements thru 'upgradation projects'. Few of my suit at site technical decisions, were apprecitaed widely by superiors & clients.</p>
